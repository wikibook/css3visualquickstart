<p>'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!  Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off).  'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?  I'm sure _I_ shan't be able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be kind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go!  Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'</p>
