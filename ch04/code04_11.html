<h1>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</h1>
	<p>The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.</p>

	<p>The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from:  that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life.</p>

	<p>The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.</p>
