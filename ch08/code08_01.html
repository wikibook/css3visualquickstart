	<h2>Characters</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Alice</strong>: The character has been said to be based on Alice Liddell, a child friend of Dodgson's. Dodgson said several times that his 'little heroine' was not based on any real child, but was entirely fictional.</li>
		<li><strong>The White Rabbit</strong>: In his article "Alice on the Stage," Carroll wrote "And the White Rabbit, what of him? Was he framed on the "Alice" lines, or meant as a contrast?</li>
		<li><strong>The Mouse:</strong>When Alice hears the mouse's "long and sad tale", she is watching his tail. So, she imagines the tale in its shape.</li>
		<li><strong>The Dodo</strong>: The Dodo is a caricature of the author. A popular but unsubstantiated belief is that Dodgson chose the particular animal to represent himself because of his stammer, and thus would accidentally introduce himself as "Do-do-dodgson."</li>
		<li><strong>The Caterpillar</strong>: Alice does not like the Caterpillar when they first meet, because he does not immediately talk to her and when he does, it is usually in short, rather rude sentences, or difficult questions.</li>
		<li><strong>The Duchess</strong>: The Duchess is an antagonist of The Queen of Hearts. In her first appearance, the Duchess seems nearly as unpleasant as the Queen herself, but later on treats Alice with friendliness and respect.</li>
		<li><strong>The Cheshire Cat</strong>: Alice first encounters it at the Duchess's house in her kitchen, and then later outside on the branches of a tree, where it appears and disappears at will, engaging Alice in amusing but sometimes vexing conversation. </li>
		<li><strong>The Hatter</strong>: The Hatter explains to Alice that he and the March Hare are always having tea because, when he tried to sing for the Queen of Hearts at a celebration of hers, she sentenced him to death for "murdering the time," but he escapes decapitation.</li>
		<li><strong>The March Hare</strong>: "Mad as a March hare" was a common phrase in Carroll's time, and appears in John Heywood's collection of proverbs published in 1546.</li>
		<li><strong>The Dormouse</strong>: The Dormouse is always falling asleep during the scene, waking up every so often.</li>
		<li><strong>The Queen of Hearts</strong>: The Queen is referred to as a card from a pack of playing cards by Alice, yet somehow she is able to talk and is the ruler of the lands in the story, alongside the King of Hearts.</li>
		<li><strong>The Knave of Hearts</strong>: The Knave of Hearts is mentioned first in chapter 8, and chapters 11 and 12 deal with his trial for a tart robbery in which the King of Hearts presides as judge.</li>
